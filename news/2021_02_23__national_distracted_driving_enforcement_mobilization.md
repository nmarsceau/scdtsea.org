[NHTSA’s Traffic Safety Marketing website](https://www.trafficsafetymarketing.gov/) features downloadable [2021 campaign materials](https://www.trafficsafetymarketing.gov/get-materials/distracted-driving/u-drive-u-text-u-pay) designed for States and traffic safety advocates, with a special [2021 PEAK Enforcement Kit](https://www.trafficsafetymarketing.gov/get-materials/distracted-driving/u-drive-u-text-u-pay/peak-enforcement-kit) designed for law enforcement. The message is clear, &ldquo;If you drive while distracted, you’ll pay.&rdquo; We anticipate that this persuasive message will resonate with the target audience of men and women 18-34.

Coming soon: 2021 Social Media Playbook
