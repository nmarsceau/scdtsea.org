We, the Driver Educators Of South Carolina, Do Hereby Dedicate Our Personal and Professional Efforts as Teachers:

* To effectively alert our students of the increasing hazards of operation of a motor vehicle.
* To increase the decision-making skills of our students, relative to the effects of alcohol, drugs, and the student's individual value system.
* To instill the traits of character that should make one a safe driver and good traffic citizen, such as respect for the rights of other drivers, obedience to laws and maintaining self-control.
* To keep abreast of changes in the field of driver education and traffic safety.
* To be constantly aware of the physical, mental, and emotional health and growth of our students.
* To work as a team in respecting the rights, the integrity, and the dignity of our fellow educators.
* To keep ever in mind our common goal to reduce the accidents and fatalities in our cities, state, and nation.
