I was fortunate to hear Dr. Mark Rasmussen at educational conferences while a teacher at Bob Jones Academy. I was reading one of his books, *101 Tips for Teaching* by Striving Together Publications. Some of his practical advice needs to be shared!

> As teachers, we must discipline ourselves in the areas of study and personal growth&hellip;

> The instructor must understand that a humble spirit will open the heart of a student&hellip;

> One of the greatest attributes an instructor can have is that of a positive and joyful spirit&hellip;

> A place of instruction should be a place of joy.

> As mentors, the greatest gift we can give is our example&hellip;remember that the students are watching to see if we are living what we are saying.

> If a student cannot trust the teacher, the instructional process is severely crippled.

> The greatest compliment a teacher has is the true respect of the student.

> As teachers, we should never underestimate the value of a life and the impact one life can make.

> Let those you mentor know that you have big dreams for them!

> The teacher needs to challenge and motivate students to do their very best.

> It is the instructor’s job to strive to be a friend to those he is mentoring&hellip;a difference between being a friend and being a &ldquo;buddy&rdquo;.

> True teaching does not just involve giving of knowledge, but also creating and stimulating (in the mind of the student) a desire to learn, but you cannot force a student to learn&hellip; So, what we do to create a thirst that will inspire a student to learn? &hellip; Use different teaching methodology&hellip;incorporating play acting, using the question as a teaching method, creating a visual aid, or procuring a book or article for students to read&hellip;

> It ought to be the goal of the instructor to constantly be praising and encouraging the student when others can hear, and then use one-on-one correction.

> Teaching is training&hellip;teaching is more than just discussing a subject in which the teacher is an expert. It involves training the student to also become an expert in that subject.

> Leaders are by their very nature, problem solvers&hellip;The teacher can accomplish his goal by explaining how a particular problem could have been avoided in the first place.

> The instructor must do everything in his power to encourage people to ask, &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are the results?&rdquo; &ldquo;How does this apply to me?&rdquo;

> The instructor must understand and realize that repetition is truly a great aid in teaching.

> One of the problems with today's educational method is the lack of repetition on certain core principles, knowledge, skills&hellip;with each additional practice run, the skill level increased until finally it become second nature.

> Repetition creates the proper mindset and the proper memory of how to carry out certain actions when an actual event occurs&hellip;time spent in practice will always reap great dividends in the performance.

> One of the most important goals an instructor can accomplish is to help the student to see where there is need for improvement&hellip;how the fault can be conquered and ultimately overcome.

Teaching is preparing students for living. I know the above nuggets will help all of us to teach better. One of my favorite professors used to say &ldquo;if the student hasn’t learned, the teacher hasn’t taught&rdquo; (Dr. Walter G. Fremont). William A. Ward gave a challenging quotation to all teachers: &ldquo;The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.&rdquo; A Chinese proverb is also food for thought: &ldquo;I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.&rdquo;
