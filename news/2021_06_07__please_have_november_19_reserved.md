Driver &amp; Traffic Safety Colleague,

I am really excited about the November 19 conference! We are going to have the best known out-of-state and in-state speakers! Andy Pilgrim will speak two times. One on &ldquo;More on Vehicle Driver Aid Technology&rdquo; and another on &ldquo;Dangers of Street Racing and Stunting Explained.&rdquo; JoEllen Suter will also have two sessions to share her expertise: &ldquo;Teaching Behind-the-Wheel&rdquo; and another on &ldquo;Teaching Classroom.&rdquo; Rick Todd, President/CEO of SC Trucking Association, will speak on &ldquo;Be Pro, Be Proud.&rdquo; Lt. Bill Rhyne and Cpl. Joe Hovis, will be speaking on the encouraging, inspiring and challenging topic of &ldquo;Why we do, what we do?&rdquo;

We have always desired some of our teachers to share teaching tips, but seem to always get the conference program too full. Perhaps some can share teaching tips that can be given in emails like this one. In fact, Alan Beckley got inspired with Ford's Driving Skills for Life and shared this classroom teaching tip:

> &ldquo;I call it a Traffic Study. First, I give a lecture on intersections, covering right-of-way, lane usage, etc. Then we talk about common moving violations such as incomplete stops, improper use of turn signals, etc. We then walk down to the nearest intersection and station ourselves at each of the four corners and record any violations and other unsafe behaviors for 10 minutes. Upon returning to the classroom we compile the data and discuss what we observed. The students not only learn what to watch for at an intersection as a driver, but also how to be safe as a pedestrian. Even in inclement weather, nobody really complains, because they enjoy the fresh air, get some exercise and it breaks up the day!&rdquo;

May more teaching tips come in! I know that we will get a bunch at the conference! I will give a few tips for BTW:
- Since students usually turn the wheel a little while making a lane change, I tell them to grip the steering wheel tight before doing the lane change, that it is psychological but that it works.
- To help students realize how easily distractions can happen, I mess up the inside mirror and tell the students to adjust it without going all over the road. I do this after the students are used to freeway driving and also when it is clear of cars. It is a matter of a quick glance at the road (I call it point-of-aim) and then to the mirror and to do such until it is adjusted. This makes a world of difference. It emphasizes to the students how staring quickly causes distractions. 
- Another tip regards the &ldquo;caution&rdquo; braking position. I do not tell the students to take their foot off the gas and put it above the brake. This could be a potential problem since the car would slow down and this would encourage someone to pull out in front of them. What I tell them is to put their left foot above the brake when a potential problem appears and doing such will shorten reaction time if they need to brake. Doing it this way, the vehicle isn't slowing down. The students are already used to the regular teaching for right foot braking. No left foot on the brake teaching for normal braking (the University of Georgia encouraged such when I was there on a scholarship program)!!

When Cpl. Joe Hovis recently spoke to my class, I got concerned when he said that the SC seat belt fine is only up to $25. I was burdened enough to work on [an article about raising the fine for not wearing a seat belt](</static/img/pdf/Most Important Driving Device - SEAT BELT.pdf>) and also share reasons to wear one. Maybe you can talk to your legislators to encourage them to raise the seat belt fine for more and better safety in our state.

Sincerely,

Joe
