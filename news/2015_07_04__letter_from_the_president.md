Dear Driverâ€™s Training Colleague,

I would like to invite you to look over our website and also to encourage you to join our association. I remember going to the conference in the 90's and thinking about my role in making the roads safer for all of us, and I realized that I could help by becoming a small part in this wonderful association. I will tell you that we are a small association and we need to increase our numbers not to just say we have a lot of members, but to be able to share more ideas between the members of the association so that we can have a better impact on improving safety on our roadways.

If you have any ideas please contact me at [davidsmith@newberry.k12.sc.us](mailto:davidsmith@newberry.k12.sc.us) or [(803) 364-2134](tel:+18033642134).

I look forward to hearing from you!

Best wishes,

*David E. Smith*
*President, SCDTSEA*
