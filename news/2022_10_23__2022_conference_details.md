November 18 will come sooner than we expect. If you plan to attend and have not already registered, fill out [this registration form](/static/img/pdf/2022_conference_details.pdf) and mail it in ASAP (still can get the early registration fee). The SCDTSEA conference will be at Columbia's Criminal Justice Academy (5400 Broad River Road)! Our theme will be &ldquo;Responsible Teaching For Responsible Driving.&rdquo; Registration will be 7:30 - 8:15 a.m.

As usual, we will start with Dr. Albert Neal&apos;s welcome, inspiring words, and prayer for the conference. Major Florence McCants will give a welcome from the Academy. There will be a few state speakers, Officers Brian Lee and Matt Southern. The conference wouldn&apos;t be complete without Andy Pilgrim being with us again, informing and exhorting. Darren Tessitore will speak on alcohol and drugs. Our president is very excited about having a round table discussion regarding classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction. Some of David&apos;s emails mentioned &ldquo;I want the people who come to this conference to be able to take 1-2 ideas back from what veteran teachers have learned and shared&hellip;to make their school better for their clients.&rdquo;

I will close by sharing a tip of something that I will be doing for my 2023 classes. So many parents have mentioned that they are very nervous driving with their teens. I studied the internet about reasonable priced student driver magnetic signs that parents can use. I purchased some from Walmart online&mdash;three signs for $6.29. I purchased enough to give one to each family. This is a great school deductible expense. It probably will be some of the best advertisement for your school besides being a quality driver educator!!

Hope to see you at the November 18 SCDTSEA Conference!

Best regards,

Joe
