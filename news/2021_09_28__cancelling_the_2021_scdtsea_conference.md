Dear Driver &amp; Traffic Safety Education Colleagues,

It has been extremely hard on the SCDTSEA Executive Committee making the conference decision. The Criminal Justice Academy had to send 21 students home last week because of the virus and mentioned what we were starting to conclude&mdash;&ldquo;cancelling seems to be the better option for now.&rdquo; One officer agreed about &ldquo;not knowing that the benefits outweigh the possible exposure in a closed environment.&rdquo; Another that &ldquo;the procedural things are not worth the risk for a one day conference.&rdquo; It was also mentioned that there would probably be a low turnout because of the virus. Although the vote is to **cancel** the 2021 Conference, we will **again** do some things this year like we did last year.

*Joe Sabbadino*
*President, SCDTSEA*
