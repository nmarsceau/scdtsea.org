Dear Driver &amp; Traffic Safety Education Colleagues,

I rushed the SCDTSEA Executive Committe in deciding the poster theme for 2021 so the information could be sent to you ASAP! [Click here to download the poster contest details](</static/img/pdf/2021 SCDTSEA Poster Contest.pdf>). It was decided a few years ago to name the contest &ldquo;Sabbadino Poster Contest&rdquo; and to give the teacher of the winning poster $50. I was a bit embarrassed for the award to have my name on it. Perhaps because my students have been fortunate to consistantly place. Let this be a challenge for you to get your students involved as I would love to see other schools place highly. In fact, why not say it is a requirement for your students to do a poster? You can select eight posters to take to the SCDTSEA Conference to be judged.

I would also like to share information about the SCTA Road Team that can be scheduled for your class. [Click here to download a letter explaining their program](</static/img/pdf/SCTA Road Team Info.pdf>). The Trucking Association also has a Be Pro Be Proud experimental mobile workshop that is already scheduled through 2021. I believe part of their goal is to get teenagers on their way in becoming a truck driver. You can schedule a time with them for 2022 if interested.

Sincerely,
Joe
