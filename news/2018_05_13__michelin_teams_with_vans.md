Michelin’s launch of their new phase of Beyond the Driving Test with their limited-edition Michelin-inspired Vans and their Street Tread Contest. A newly released survey of U.S. teens conducted by Michelin North America in seven major U.S. cities reveals that 42 percent are driving with unsafe tire tread, and 40 percent are driving with improper tire pressure. To address this serious threat to the nation’s youngest drivers, Michelin is expanding its Beyond the Driving Test program. In this new phase of Beyond the Driving Test, Michelin aims to reach 1 million teen drivers with its #StreetTreadContest. To help further tell the story of the campaign, youth culture brand Vans partnered with Michelin to design limited-edition versions of Vans Classic Sk8-Hi and Old Skool shoes. ADTSEA supports Michelin’s efforts to reduce crashes and young driver fatalities.

To acquire one of the limited-edition Michelin-inspired Vans, teens must prove their street tread by sharing a photo showing that they know how to check a tire’s tread depth using a penny and/or know how to check tire pressure. Michelin will select 100 teen drivers throughout the summer, and the exclusive, limited-edition sneakers will be delivered to winners of the #StreetTreadContest after students return to school in the fall. Please share this with driving schools, driving instructors and teens through email, social media and website. **To learn about critical tire safety checks and how to enter the #StreetTreadContest for a pair of limited-edition Vans, visit** [beyondthedrivingtest.com/streettreadcontest](https://beyondthedrivingtest.com/streettreadcontest/). [Click here for the full press release](https://michelinmedia.com/pages/blog/detail/article/c0/a728/).
