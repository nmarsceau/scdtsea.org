Ten Little Drivers, cruising down the line. One had a heavy foot and then there were nine. *Speed limits are set for your safety.*

Nine Little Drivers, the hour was getting late. One dozed a moment, and then were eight. *A tired driver is a dangeorus one.*

Eight Little Drivers and the evening seemed like heaven. One showed his driving skill, and then there were seven. *Drive sensibly and sanely at all times. a vehicle is no place for a crown.*

Seven Little Drivers and their lives were full of kicks. One bought a bottle and then there were six. *Gasoline and alcohol are a deadly mix. don't drink and drive.*

Six Little Drivers, impatient to arrive. One jumped a traffic light, and then there were five. *Don't gamble years of your life to save a few seconds.*

Five Little Drivers, wheeling near the shore. One viewed the scenery, and then there were four. *Careful driving demands alertness at all times. keep your eyes on the road.*

Four Little Drivers, happy as could be. One passed a car on a hill, and then there were three. *Never pass another vehicle when your vision is obscured.*

Three Little Drivers, busy it is true. One neglected car repairs, and then there were two. *For safety's sake, keep your vehicle in top condition.*

Two Little Drivers and the day was nearly done. One didn't beam his lights, and then there was one. *Slow down for dusk or darkness. Adjust your driving to existing conditions.*

One Little Driver, who's still alive today. By following the safety rules, he hopes to stay that way.
