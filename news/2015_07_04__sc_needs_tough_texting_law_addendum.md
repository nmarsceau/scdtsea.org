We shared earlier that Georgia's texting law includes a $150 fine and 1 driving record point penalty. We feel more information about Georgia's law could be helpful.

According to national studies, approximately 22 percent of all crashes and 16 percent of all fatal crashes were caused by some form of distraction occurring within three seconds of the crash. A Georgia survey was given to drivers. Thirty-seven percent of drivers admitted to texting while driving.

Georgia also knew that studies compare the distraction caused by cell phones use to the slower reaction times of an impaired driver, and that the number one responsibility behind the wheel is paying attention to the roadway.

Effective July 1, 2010, Georgia law states that no person who is 18 years of age or who has a license shall operate a motor vehicle on any public road or highway of this state while using a wireless telecommunications device. Under this law drivers cannot write, send, or read a text message, email, or use the internet on any wireless device while driving. This includes texting at red lights or turn lanes. The rare exceptions are reserved for reporting crimes, accidents and emergencies. Prohibited behavior and texting during a crash would double the fine.

May this additional information be helpful to you. [Read more at gahighwaysafety.org](https://www.gahighwaysafety.org/).
