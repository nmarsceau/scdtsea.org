If everyone who drives a car
   Could lie a month in bed,
With broken bones and stitched up wounds,
   Or fractures of the head,
And there endure the agonies
   That many people do,
They'd never need preach safety
   Any more to me or you.

If everyone could stand beside
   The bed of some close friend
And hear the doctor say &ldquo;No hope&rdquo;
   Before the fatal end,
And see him there unconscious
   Never knowing what took place,
The laws and rules of traffic
   I'm sure we'd soon embrace.

If everyone could meet
   The wife and children left behind
And step into the darkened home
   Where once the sunlight shined,
And look upon &ldquo;that vacant chair&rdquo;,
   Where daddy used to sit
I'm sure each reckless driver
   Would be forced to think a bit.

If everyone who takes the wheel
   Would say a little prayer,
And keep in mind those in the car
   Depending upon his care
And make a vow and pledge himself
   To never take a chance,
This (our) great crusade for safety
   Would suddenly advance.
