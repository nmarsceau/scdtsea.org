SCDTSEA needs young teachers to take on the challenge of leadership positions in our association. Many of our past/present officers are/have retired or will be in the not too distant future.

Thank you for thinking about taking up leadership for SCDTSEA. More discussion will be at the Fall Teacher's Workshop.
