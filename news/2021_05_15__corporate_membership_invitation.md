The South Carolina Driver and Traffic Safety Educators Association (SCDTSEA) is the only one of its kind that represents all driver and traffic safety educators in South Carolina and works with other safety groups in the state. SCDTSEA is a nonprofit seeking to have Corporate Memberships to better accomplish our mission. You would be interested to know that our overall mission and purpose is stated as the following:

**Mission Statement**
*The SCDTSEA supports and advances traffic safety and education among commercial and public driving schools. Its members work together to promote solutions and laws related to driver safety and education.*

**Purpose**
- Serve as spokesperson for driver &amp; traffic safety education educators in South Carolina.
- Advance the cause of driver &amp; traffic safety education for all individuals.
- Stimulate the general interest of all individuals in the total program of driver &amp; traffic safety through a wide variety of informative resources.
- Promote professional excellence along with the basic importance of the safety educator in the learning process.
- Protect the rights of safety educators and advance their interests and welfare.

With a need to create new, innovative and virtual ways to communicate driver and traffic safety education, we are launching a fundraising campaign. Currently, we charge a minimal annual membership fee of $30 to make it affordable for driver trainers to join. Additionally, we want as many members as possible to attend our annual conference so the conference fee for location, materials, and lunch is only $50. It is our desire to send printed update newsletters to all driver and traffic safety educators within the state. We aspire to reintroduce our annual youth safety conference once held in South Carolina. We would also very much like to re-energize our driving poster contest for all state driver training students with renewed sponsorship. Of course, these driver education tools come at an expense which our reasonable membership fees will not cover. We rely on the backing of partners like you who take driver education to heart. We would appreciate the support of you and your organization by becoming a Corporate Member. Your donation is vital to keeping our SCDTSEA program moving forward.

Thank you for considering a gift to our annual campaign. Please take a look at the [Corporate Membership form](</static/img/pdf/Corporate Membership Form.pdf>) outlining our benefit levels.

If it wasn't for your commitment to our community, it would not be possible for us to provide our citizens with much needed driver education messaging. Thank you deeply for investing in the education, safety and future of South Carolinians.

With profound gratitude,

*Joe Sabbadino*
*President, SCDTSEA*
