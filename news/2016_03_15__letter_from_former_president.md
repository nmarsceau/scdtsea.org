Mark November 18, 2016 on your calendar for the SCDTSEA Conference. It will again be at Blythewood, SC’s SCDMV! Expect the conference to be as excellent as the 2015 conference! One of the foremost national safety experts has already been contacted. Mr. Andy Pilgrim gave a powerful presentation on &ldquo;The Realities of Driving Today&rdquo; at the last Southeast Region American Driver & Traffic Safety Education Conference, and also gave out his new CD.

We will again have a poster contest and this year’s theme will be DISTRACTED DRIVING. The posters should be done on regulation size posters (22x28). Have your students write the following on the back of the poster: their name, address and phone number, as well as the name of your school. Each school can bring up to eight posters that their 2016 students made. The posters will be judged during the SCDTSEA Conference by non-driver educators. Cash prizes will be given to the top three posters (eligible only if a representative from your school is at the conference).

Think about recommending an outstanding teacher for both the commercial school and high school teacher-of-the-year. You can also recommend someone for the outstanding administrator of the year. If you want to make a recommendation, send it to me at [jandjsabb@att.net](mailto:jandjsabb@att.net). I will forward it to the proper committee during a SCDTSEA Board Meeting.

Rev. Ben Colley, Community Outreach Coordinator of the South Carolina Highway Patrol, has been at SCDTSEA Conferences with the seat belt demonstrator. I decided to have him come during one of my classes. Ben brought the seat belt demonstrator and he also had Corporal W. T. Rhyne (Office of Community Relations, South Carolina Highway Patrol) come. They gave a most outstanding talk/presentation in about 30 minutes. I would encourage you have them come to your school also. Email Ben at [blcolley@schp.org](mailto:blcolley@schp.org). His office phone is [(803) 896-8180](tel:+18038968180) and cell is [(803) 206-8523](tel:+18032068523).
