The following are explanations for various automobile accidents which were taken from insurance claim forms by Tilden Ltd., Canada's foremost car rental agency.

* Coming home, I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don't have.
* A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face.
* The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times before I hit him.
* In my attempt to kill a fly, I drove into a telephone pole.
* The gentleman behind me struck me on the backside. He then went to rest in the bush with just his rear end showing.
* I told the police I was not injured, but on removing my hat I found I had a fractured skull.
* I was sure the old fellow would never make it to the other side of the road when I struck him.
* When I saw that I could not avoid a collision, I stepped on the gas and subsequently crashed into the other car.
* I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law in the other seat and headed over the embankment.
* I had been driving my car for 40 years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident.
* To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.
* I first saw the slow-moving, sad-faced old gentleman when he bounced off the hood of my car.
* The accident happened when the right front door of a car came around the corner without giving any signal.
* The telephone pole was approaching fast. I was attempting to swerve out of its way when it struck my front end.
* A pedestrian I did not see, hit me then went sliding under my car.
* The pedestrian had no idea which direction to go, so I ran over him.
* The accident occurred when I was attempting to bring my car out of a skid by steering it into the other vehicle.
* An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my vehicle, and then vanished.
* I had been learning to drive with power steering. I turned the wheel to what I thought was enough and found myself going in the opposite direction.
