Dear Colleagues,

She will be getting the best Indoor Garden Basket today from SCDTSEA. The message: &ldquo;Deepest sympathy from friends and colleagues of the South Carolina Driver and Traffic Safety Education Association. Harry meant so much to all. Joe Sabbadino, President, SCDTSEA.&rdquo;

As much as we do not like the thought, we are born to die but to also live again after death (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 2). At this solemn time, it may be fitting to end with some quotations on death.

> &ldquo;Live as you will have wished to have lived when you are dying.&rdquo;
> <span class="indent-1">&ndash; <cite>Christian F. Geilert</cite></span>

> &ldquo;Death is the great key that opens the place of Eternity.&rdquo;
> <span class="indent-1">&ndash; <cite>John Milton</cite></span>

> &ldquo;Death is not a period but a comma in the story of life.&rdquo;
> <span class="indent-1">&ndash; <cite>A. J. Traver</cite></span>

> &ldquo;Death is the gate of life.&rdquo;
> <span class="indent-1">&ndash; <cite>St. Bernard of Clairvaux</cite></span>

> &ldquo;You are not ready to live until you are ready to die.&rdquo;
> <span class="indent-1">&ndash; <cite>Pastor Norman Eoute</cite></span>

> &ldquo;Death is but life to a true believer; it is not his last day, nor his worst day, but in the highest sense his best day, and the beginning of his better life.&rdquo;

> &ldquo;I hate life, and yet I hate to die.&rdquo;
> <span class="indent-1">&ndash; <cite>Voltaire</cite></span>

> &ldquo;For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.&rdquo;
> <span class="indent-1">&ndash; <cite>The Apostle Paul</cite></span>

> &ldquo;Dying men have said, 'I am sorry I have been an atheist, an infidel, an agnostic, a skeptic, or a sinner'; but no man ever said with his last breath, 'I am sorry I have lived a Christian life.'&rdquo;

There are so many wonderful things to remember about Dr. Harry Stille. I know that those of us who knew him are thankful that we were &ldquo;touched&rdquo; by him.

Sincerely,
*Joe*
