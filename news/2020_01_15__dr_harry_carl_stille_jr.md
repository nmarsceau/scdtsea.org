Dear Colleagues,

Our beloved Dr. Harry Stille died yesterday morning. He still lives, but not with us. All of the arrangements are not available yet, but you could get on the internet for Harris Funeral Home in Abbeville for additional information. If you want to send sympathy cards to Mrs. Harry Stille, it is: Reba Stille, 5 Bernice Brown Lane, Due West, SC 29639. She will be getting the best Indoor Garden Basket today from SCDTSEA. The message: &ldquo;Deepest sympathy from friends and colleagues of the South Carolina Driver and Traffic Safety Education Association. Harry meant so much to all. Joe Sabbadino, President, SCDTSEA.&rdquo;

As much as we do not like the thought, we are born to die but to also live again after death (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 2). At this solemn time, it may be fitting to end with some quotations on death.

> &ldquo;Live as you will have wished to have lived when you are dying.&rdquo;
> > &ndash; Christian F. Geilert

> &ldquo;Death is the great key that opens the place of Eternity.&rdquo;
> > &ndash; John Milton

> &ldquo;Death is not a period but a comma in the story of life.&rdquo;
> > &ndash; A. J.Traver

> &ldquo;Death is the gate of life.&rdquo;
> > &ndash; St. Bernard of Clairvaux

> &ldquo;You are not ready to live until you are ready to die.&rdquo;
> > &ndash; Pastor Norman Eoute

> &ldquo;Death is but life to a true believer; it is not his last day, nor his worst day, but in the highest sense his best day, and the beginning of his better life.&rdquo;

> &ldquo;I hate life, and yet I hate to die.&rdquo;
> > &ndash; Voltaire

> &ldquo;For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.&rdquo;
> > &ndash; Paul

> &ldquo;Dying men have said, 'I am sorry I have been an atheist, an infidel, an agnostic, a skeptic, or a sinner'; but no man ever said with his last breath, 'I am sorry I have lived a Christian life.'&rdquo;
> > &ndash; Dr. Bob Jones, Sr.

> &ldquo;Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from hencefort...that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.&rdquo;
> > &ndash; Revelation 14:13

> &ldquo;Life with Christ is an endless hope; life without Christ is a hopeless end. Take care of your life and the Lord will take care of your death.&rdquo;
> > &ndash; George Whitefield

There are so many wonderful things to remember about Dr. Harry Stille. I know that those of us who knew him are thankful that we were &ldquo;touched&rdquo; by him.

Sincerely,
*Joe*
