  I am a graduate of USC-Upstate with a BS in Physical Education. I received A Masters in Sports Administration from the United States Sports Academy and my 30 hours above from the University of LaVerne. I completed course work to become certified in Driverâ€™s Education from Erskine.


  I am a teacher and coach in Spartanburg School District One at Chapman High School. I am currently the associate head football coach and formerly the head baseball coach. I have coached and taught in District One my entire career.


  My wife, Susan, is a first grade teacher, also in District One. I am the proud father of three daughters, Jennifer, Madison, and Mallory. Jennifer, a Clemson graduate, is married and the mother of a son, Hayes, just three months old. Madison is a sophomore at Winthrop University and Mallory is a senior at Chapman High School. We live in the small community of Holly Springs just outside of Inman, S.C.
