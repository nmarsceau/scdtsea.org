  I am 54 years old of Baptist faith and have been married to my wife Penny for thirty one years. We have three children. I have been working at Cone Mills finishing plant since 1981. I coached the Union County High School boys tennis team from 2004-2015. I have been an official for high school basketball for nineteen years. I started Union County Driving Academy in 2011. We serve Union and the surrounding counties. My main classroom focus is distracted driving, alcohol, drugs, and right of way scenarios.
