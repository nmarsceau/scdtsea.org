bio: >-
  I have lived in Greenville, SC my entire life. I am a graduate of Parker High School. My wife Jean and I were married in 1978 and have a daughter April and a son Jason who both are employed by Budget Driving School. We also have two grandsons and a new granddaughter. I began teaching CDL training and administering the CDL test in the early 1990's. In 1994 we opened Budget Driving School and began with one car and have grown to 8 cars. I specialize in teaching adult clients with both physical and mental difficulties as well as many adults who have come to South Carolina from other countries. At the present time I teach classroom training, hand-control training, behind the wheel instructions and administer both the Knowledge Test and the Skills Test at Budget Driving School.
