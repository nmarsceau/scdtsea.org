bio: >-
  I was born and raised in Charleston, SC until 1972 when I moved to Columbia, SC. I attended Spring Valley High School and graduated in 1974. During that time I drove a school bus while attending school and also worked a part time job as a cashier at Winn Dixie. I married my high school sweetheart Danny McNair in 1974 who has been in the transportation field for over 35 years. He was a supervisor of a trucking company for 30 years and now is an agent for several Freight Brokers. I have two children Danny McNair II, and a daughter Brandi McNair. I have two grandchildren Bryce, 6 and Jordan, 3 and another on the way due in July 2016. I have worked in the medical field in various capacities for 42 years, and currently I am at Palmetto Health Richland as a Quality Control/Physicians Billing Coordinator. I am also an Instructor at Championship Driving School with offices in Lugoff and Lancaster. We have 7 instructors, drive students from a lot of different schools, and teach adults as well. During the years I have been an Advocate for Sexual Trauma Services, coached T-ball, coached Dixie Youth Softball, and was a board member for the Dixie Youth Baseball Softball League and various other committees. I have seen firsthand the devastation that Motor Vehicle Crashes can cause. I strive to be the best instructor possible and use my experience in the medical field to apply some reasoning in teaching my students to be the very best on the road that they can possibly be.
