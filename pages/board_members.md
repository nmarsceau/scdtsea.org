      I graduated from Presbyterian College in 1988 with a degree in History and a minor in Secondary Education. I was certified in Driver’s Education from Erskine College in the summer of 1992 and was taught by the living legend himself, Dr. Harry Stille. I have been teaching driver’s training since 1992 at Whitmire High School, Berkeley High School and Barnwell High School. I currently teach Driver’s Educationat Mid-Carolina High School.


      I’ve been married since 1997 to the former Angela Shealy of Columbia, SC. She is a 1st grade teacher in Calhoun County (Sandy Run Elementary). We have an 15 year old daughter, Katelyn, who is a sophomore at White Knoll School. Katelyn has been in remission from cancer since 2002!


      I am also the owner of Coaches Driving Academy in Moncks Corner and Lexington, SC. This company was started in 2002. I have been a member of SCDTSEA since 1992 and I have served as President-Elect and President in the past. I am currently the President and I truly am excited about the direction the association is heading. I believe in this association because I believe that we truly want the best for the drivers in this state and we are not on a political agenda.
